## ✨📚 Philosophy & Literature

I find wonder in words and meaning — and I'm enchanted by:

- *Fyodor Dostoevsky* – the soul’s darkest corners lit by raw, reflective brilliance.
- *Franz Kafka* – surreal visions wrapped in quiet shadows.
- *Albert Camus* – the elegance of absurdity and silent rebellion.

> “Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart.”  
> — *Fyodor Dostoevsky*

Literature is where I breathe, and philosophy is how I dream — both inspire my inner world and the code I create.
